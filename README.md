# Akhileshwar - AI Engineering Portfolio

A high-performance, interactive 3D portfolio designed to showcase advanced work in Artificial Intelligence, Generative AI, and Robotics.

![Portfolio Preview](screenshot.png)

## 🚀 Overview

This portfolio is built with the "Apple Liquid Glass" aesthetic in mind—featuring heavy use of **glassmorphism**, **smooth physics-based animations**, and **interactive 3D elements**. It serves as a central hub for my technical achievements, including production-grade RAG systems, computer vision research, and autonomous robotics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js 15+ (App Router)](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Animations**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) (orchestration, layout transitions)
- **3D Graphics**: Custom Mathematical Projection (Zero-dependency 3D Tag Cloud)
- **Language**: TypeScript

## ✨ Key Features

- **Liquid Glass Header**: A scroll-triggered, dynamic navigation dock with frosted glass effects (`backdrop-filter`) that smoothly animates into view.
- **3D Skills Globe**: A mathematically generated, interactive rotating sphere of technical skills that responds to hover state, built without heavy 3D libraries for maximum performance.
- **Spotlight Project Grid**: An interactive "Bento" grid where project cards feature a localized radial gradient "spotlight" that follows the user's cursor.
- **Immersive Project Modals**: Layout animations expand project cards into focused full-screen details, enforcing a premium user experience.
- **Role-Specific Resume**: Simplified, direct access to the specialized AI Engineering curriculum vitae.

## 📂 Featured Projects

1. **Authoritative RAG Engine**: Production system with semantic caching (Redis) reducing latency by 98%.
2. **Brain Tumor Classification**: Medical AI achieving 99% accuracy using ResNet-50 and Vision Transformers.
3. **Autonomous Robotic Weaver**: IoT spider-robot integrating Computer Vision and MQTT.
4. **Music Genre Classification**: Deep Learning pipeline using CNNs and GANs for audio analysis.
5. **Maritime Bidding Agent**: Game-theoretic agent optimizing reverse Vickrey auctions.
6. **Theme Discovery**: Unsupervised NLP clustering on the text8 corpus.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running Locally
